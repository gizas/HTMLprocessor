HTML Processing and extraction of metrics

This project is a tool for automating the extraction of various metrics from real URLs.

From this tool you can just make your own list of sites (in links.txt) and just by running the code you 
can extract following metrics:

Healstad like-Metrics
Script Metrics
HTML5 Tags Metrics
Stylesheet Metrics
Complexity Metrics
Structure Metrics
--------------------------------------------

HTMLprocessor.java : The main java file
html5tags.txt      : The HTML5 tag list
Output.txt         : The metrics file
